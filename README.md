# üç≤ Personal Recipe App with FastAPI + AWS (CDK-first Architecture)

A personal online cookbook app where a user can enter recipes (ingredients, quantities, instructions), view them, print them as PDFs, and email them ‚Äî built using **FastAPI** and deployed with **AWS CDK** to learn both backend development and AWS Developer skills.

---

## üéØ Project Goals
- Recipe entry & view
- PDF generation & email
- FastAPI backend
- React frontend
- AWS backend (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, SES)
- Use AWS CDK (Python) as primary infrastructure-as-code tool

## üß± AWS Infrastructure Overview

| Component    | AWS Service           | Purpose                                   |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| API          | Lambda + FastAPI       | Backend logic via serverless functions     |
| API Gateway  | API Gateway            | Expose API routes publicly                 |
| DB           | DynamoDB               | Store recipes (NoSQL)                      |
| File Storage | S3                     | Store generated PDFs                       |
| Email        | SES                    | Send recipe PDFs via email                |
| Permissions  | IAM Roles              | Secure access between services             |
| Deployment   | AWS CDK (Python)       | Infrastructure as code                     |

## üõ† Action Plan

### ‚úÖ Step 0: Environment Setup
- [ ] Install AWS CLI, configure `aws configure`
- [ ] Install Node.js and CDK: `npm install -g aws-cdk`
- [ ] Set up Python venv
- [ ] `cdk bootstrap`
- [ ] `cdk init app --language python`

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Basic FastAPI App
- [ ] Create FastAPI app with recipe CRUD routes
- [ ] Wrap with `Mangum` for Lambda compatibility

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Deploy API with CDK
- [ ] Create CDK Lambda resource
- [ ] Create CDK API Gateway resource
- [ ] Connect FastAPI to API Gateway
- [ ] Deploy: `cdk deploy`

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Add DynamoDB
- [ ] Define `recipes` table in CDK
- [ ] Give Lambda read/write permissions
- [ ] Use `boto3` or `aioboto3` to interact in FastAPI

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Generate PDFs
- [ ] Add endpoint `/recipes/{id}/pdf`
- [ ] Use `WeasyPrint`, `pdfkit`, or `reportlab`
- [ ] Upload to S3 and return link

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Email PDF via SES
- [ ] Set up SES + verify email in console
- [ ] Use `boto3` to send email with attached PDF or S3 link

---

### ‚úÖ Step 6: React Frontend
- [ ] Form to create recipes
- [ ] List to view them
- [ ] Buttons to download/email PDF

---

### ‚úÖ Step 7: (Optional) Authentication
- [ ] Add token-based access (simple or Cognito-based)

---

## üîß Tools

Install in Python env:

```bash
pip install fastapi mangum boto3 weasyprint
```

CDK Project:

```bash
pip install aws-cdk-lib constructs aws-cdk.aws-lambda-python-alpha
```

| Monitoring         | CloudWatch      |



# Welcome to your CDK Python project!

This is a blank project for CDK development with Python.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the `.venv`
directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
